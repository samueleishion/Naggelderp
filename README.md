## How to run 

```python
python main.py 
```

Upon running, you should expect 3 lists of 10 iteams each. These are 1grams, 2grams, and 3grams. Really, these are the counts of letters (or groups of letters) that are most common in all the words in the video. 

At the end, you will see a random word that has been generated based on these analytics and some random factors. 

## TODOs

The next step would be to add a better interface to the program, and maybe create a webapp with flair and data viz.
